      Social web/mobile application for creating, sharing, tracing and walking through the routes.
The application for laptop, tablet or mobile phone allows users to create tourist routes all over the world 
from the places registered at FourSuare (see below for the website URL). Media content, map and 
descriptions may be added for each place. Other users may find created routes in the Shop inside the app 
and walk through them. While walking through, the user checks in with FourSquare, gets relevant content 
about the place. This app may help you choose the best route and keep a record of your travels. When 
complete, or at any time, you can see a map of all the spots you visited and share your route.
